# Tic-Tac-Toe
The goal of the project was to create a simple application for tic-tac-toe game. At the beggining players choose pawns (circle or cross), and then take turns choosing the fields on which their pawns are placed. The game ends when one of the players creates a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line from their three pawns.

The project was intended to consolidate the scope of material from the first part of Alex Allain's book - "Jumping into C++".
